# Experience - Radio mapping of the Milky Way using 21-cm line

## Introduction
This experience is focused on the analysis of the 21-cm emission line from hydrogen and its use to map the structure of the Milky Way using the SALSA radio telescope unit at the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden. 

You can find a tutorial that is designed to prepare for the main analysis of the experience.

## Objectives
Since its discovery in 1951, the 21-cm HI transition line has been used as an important indicator for the distribution of molecular gas clouds (neutral hydrogen) in the interstellar medium, which has helped delineate the structure of the Milky Way. 

Based on the Doppler shift observed in these measurements, we derived the galactic rotation curve. We then explored its relationship with the visible mass and dark matter in the galaxy. 

Finally, using the components of the cloud velocity as a function of the distance from the center of the galaxy, the spiral arms were traced.

## Structure of the package
The package contains the following directories

* *tutorials*: Contains Python Jupyter notebooks for the tutorials
* *data*: Contains data required to run the tutorials
* *results_julia*: Contains the pictures of our results for our final report.
