# Experience - Multiwavelength analysis of a Gamma Ray Burst

## Introduction
This experience is focused on the analysis of a GRB as observed by the Fermi-GBM instrument, and to use objects and classes to build a simple timing analysis.

After having looked at the set of tutorials, we developed a small project of GRB analysis.

## Objectives
In this experience, we will closely explore an event observed by the Fermi mission in 2009, GRB090926A.

The first part will focus on characterizing the phenomenon's light curves and identifying the event.

The second part will focus on analyzing the spectrum in various energy bands and identifying an effective model to describe it.
- Spectral fitting
- Spectral hardness
- Isotropic energy

## Structure of the package
The package contains the following directories

* *tutorials*: Contains Python Jupyter notebooks for the tutorials
* *data*: Contains data required to run the tutorials
* *results*: Contains pictures of the results for a final report.
