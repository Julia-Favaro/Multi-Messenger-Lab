# Homework 01 - Data Input/Output with Python
Version: AA 2023-2024

## Introduction
This set of Python Notebooks and exercises are meant to be help in getting more familiar with the
Python functions used to read and manipulate datasets in two main formats used in multimessenger
science:

* CSV (Comma-separated values): ASCII-based text files
* FITS (Flexible Image Transport Sysyem), the standard in astrophysics

Later on, in future tutorials, we will see more formats, but for now let's focus on these two.

## What do you have to do?
You will find 2 sets of tutorial+exercises:
* **Set 1** - Reading and manipulating CSV files
* **Set 2** - Reading and manipulating FITS files

For each set, first look at the **tutorial**, check the code, run it and do modifications in order to be sure that you've understand how it works.

Then you can move to the **exercises**, where you will be asked to perform some tasks and solve some
real-life cases of data analysis.

## Structure of the package
The package contains the following directories

* *tutorials*: Contains Python Juyter notebooks for the tutorials
* *exercises*: Contains Python Juyter notebooks for the exercises
* *data*: Contains data required to run the tutorial and the exercises

## Final thoughts
Some of you know Python well, some reasonably well, and some do not.
I hope these will be useful at different level for each of you to get more pratice on slightly advanced Python data analysis. 

These exercises will be useful for the various experiences of the course, so take advantage it it and enjoy!
