# Homework 02 - Manipulation of Astrophysical data with Astropy and Pandas

Version: AA 2023-2024

## Introduction
This set of Python Notebooks and exercises are meant to be help in getting more familiar with the
Python libraries Numpy, Astropy and Pandas, that are used to manipulate tables and data in the astrophysical contect.
In particular you can find more information on the Official pages of these packages:

* [Official Page of the Numerical Python (numpy)](https://numpy.org/)
* [Official Page of the Astropy project](http://www.astropy.org)
* [Official Page of Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

After having looked at a set of tutorials you will develop a small project to look for spatial correlations among source catalogs.

## What do you have to do?
You will find one sets of tutorials and a final exercise:
* **Tutorial 01** - [Basics of Numerical Python](tutorials/tutorial01-numpy-basics.ipynb)
* **Tutorial 02** - [Managing times with Astropy](tutorials/tutorial02-astropy-times.ipynb)
* **Tutorial 03** - [Managing coordinates with Astropy](tutorials/tutorial03-astropy-coordinates.ipynb)
* **Tutorial 04** - [Basics of Pandas](tutorials/tutorial04-pandas.ipynb)
* **Tutorial 05** - [Putting all together: Pandas and FITS files](tutorials/tutorial05-pandas-fits.ipynb)

Once you have read these **tutorial**, check the code, run it and do modifications in order to be sure that you've understand how it works.

Then you can move to the [**exercise**](exercises/exercise01-x-gamma-catalogs.ipynb), where you will be asked to perform some tasks and solve a real-life cases of data analysis, in this case looking for spatial correlations among X-ray and gamma-ray sources.

## Structure of the package
The package contains the following directories

* *tutorials*: Contains Python Juyter notebooks for the tutorials
* *exercises*: Contains Python Juyter notebooks for the exercises
* *data*: Contains data required to run the tutorial and the exercises
