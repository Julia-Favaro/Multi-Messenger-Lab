### Experience - Data Analysis of Gravitational Waves

## Introduction
This set of Python Notebooks introduces you to the material used for the experience on gravitational waves data analysis.

# Objectives
The first part of this project will cover the characterization of the GW event noise with an amplitude spectral density analysis. 

The second part will focus on the frequency domain: 
- Create a TimeSeries object and use a notch filter 
- Match filter your event with a template for a Compact Binary Merger
  
## Structure of the package
The package contains the following directories

* *data*: Directory to store the data used for this experience from the GWOSC website;
* *tutorials*: Contains Python Jupyter notebooks used as a tutorial for the analysis;
* *code*: Contains a sample Python Jupyter notebook to be used for theanalysis;
