    "Few notes:\n",
    "* An important strategy is to put every class in a separate file (in this case in the file Dog.py in this same directory)\n",
    "* The name of the class is uppercase (e.g.  Dog.py)\n",
    "* The file that you want to import should be in the same directory (as in this case), or in another location. But in this case, in order to tell Python where to find the files to import, you should add the directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Let us suppose that you want to import the file MyClass.py in the directory /home/user/mydir. You should then run this command in the bash shell: *export PYTHONPATH=/home/user/mydir:$PYTHONPATH*. In this way you will add the directory to the existing PYTHONPATH. Another way to this from the script or the Jupyter notebook is to append the directory to the *sys.path* variable, i.e. *sys.path.append(\"/home/user/mydir\")"
