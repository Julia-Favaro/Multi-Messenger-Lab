# Experience - Imaging and Photometry in Optical Bandwidth with CCD

## Introduction
This experience is focused on the analysis of optical data taken with a CCD and an optical telescope, performing image calibration and photometry.

You can find a tutorial that is designed to prepare for the main analysis of the experience.

## Objectives
The first part of this project will cover the characterization of the device used, with particular attention to the noise removal and light frame calibration processes.
- Master bias
- Master dark
- Master flat
- Readout noise
- Science images

The second part will focus on the photometric measurements of a star cluster, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the apparent visible magnitude of some of its stars, calibrating the instrumental magnitude with a clearly visible star in the sky.
- Preprocessing the data
- Calibration
- Photometry
- PSF characterization

## Structure of the package
